Task: Read the provided excerpt from temp_context.xml (Bible verses in Swedish). Directly edit the text by replacing archaic or outdated words/phrases with modern Swedish equivalents (e.g., "de kunna" → "de kan", "vi vilja" → "vi vill", "fören ut" → "för ut", "han berömme" → "han ska berömma"). No other sources or files are needed. Only read the text and replace the old words.

Preserve:
- Names, places, and theological terms (do not modernize these).
- Sentence structure, punctuation, and XML tags.

No names of persons or places are altered.
Simple and modern language is preferred over "stylistic" tone. Make sure to NOT copy existing bible translations.
No spacing or alignment is changed.

Output: Apply the changes inline in the temp_context.xml file. Do not add explanations or JSON - only the modified text. No other report or summary is needed.
