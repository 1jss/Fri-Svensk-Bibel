Task: Read the provided excerpt from temp_context.xml (Bible verses in Swedish). Directly edit the text by replacing archaic or outdated words/phrases with modern Swedish equivalents (e.g., "de kunna" → "de kan", "vi vilja" → "vi vill", "fören ut" → "för ut", "han berömme" → "han ska berömma"). No other sources or files are needed. Only read the text and replace the old words.

Preserve:
- Sentence structure, punctuation, and XML tags.
- Names, places, and theological terms (do not modernize these).

No names of persons or places are altered.
Simple and modern language is preferred over "stylistic" tone.
No spacing or alignment is changed.
Output: The full edited text with all changes applied inline. Do not add explanations or JSON—only the modified text.
