Task: Read the provided excerpt from temp_context.xml file (in old Swedish). Directly edit the text by replacing archaic or outdated words/phrases with modern Swedish equivalents (e.g., "de kunna" → "de kan", "vi vilja" → "vi vill", "fören ut" → "för ut", "han berömme" → "han ska berömma"). No other sources or files are needed. Only read the text and replace the old sounding words. If needed also change the sentence structure.

Preserve:
- Names, places, and theological terms (do not modernize or alter these).
- Punctuation, spacing, alignment and XML tags should be kept as is.

Simple and modern language is preferred over "stylistic" tone. Make sure to NOT copy or take inspiration from existing Swedish bible translations. The tone should be simpler and more modern than that.

Output: Only apply the changes inline in the temp_context.xml file. Do not add any explanations. No other report or summary is needed.
